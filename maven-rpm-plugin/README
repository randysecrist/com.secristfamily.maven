This is the file README for the maven-rpm plugin.

This plugin depends on the rpmbuild, cp, rsync, install, mv, and other sytem
commands.  Most of these commands are installed as part of standard linux
packages, however you may want to verify that the rpm-build package is installed
as some distributions leave that out.

Please send all comments and bug reports by electronic mail to:
   Randy Secrist <randy.secrist@gmail.com>

or, if this fails, to randy.secrist@gmail.com.
Bug reports should ideally include:

    * The complete output of executing maven.
    * The pom.xml the plugin is being used within.
    * A sample of what you would like your resulting RPM artifact to look like.
